### Agile Methodology
In my Agile approach, I utilised GitHub Projects to outline the desired functionality and acceptance criteria. This platform offers a visual depiction of my work progress and assists in task management. While initially focusing on features essential for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), I found myself incorporating additional ideas to enhance interactivity and user experience throughout the development process.

### Colour Scheme

![image](https://github.com/Stephanniee/Hell_Paradise/assets/140328398/36c88830-0129-472c-8dfb-921014636169)

The combination of pink, green, purple, and white creates a visually pleasing and dynamic color scheme, with each color complementing and enhancing the others. Throughout the anime, this vibrant palette is thrown out, saturating the scenes with a sense of vibrancy and welcome, much like the paradise depicted in the series. However, there's an underlying sense of danger too, as these colors can also be symbolic of the unpredictability and peril that the characters face in their journey. The hues pulsate with energy, drawing viewers into the lush and enchanting world of the anime, while also hinting at the lurking dangers that lie beneath its seemingly idyllic surface.

### Validator Testing
Extensive testing was carried out to guarantee flawless functionality. Validator testing tools were employed to pinpoint and resolve potential issues. Responsive testing was conducted to ensure seamless compatibility across various screen sizes and devices.
-	HTML: No errors were encountered when subjected to the official [W3C validator], except for the anticipated errors related to stray doctypes.
-	CSS: There were no errors detected by the official [(Jigsaw) validator].
-	Python: Apart from minor issues such as blank lines and lines exceeding length limits, no errors were identified. The code was successfully passed through [CI Python Linte].
-	JavaScript: No errors were identified during validation using the [jshint validator].
### Bugs
During the migration process, a critical issue arose where the file couldn't be found, prompting further investigation into the database to verify the existence of the required table. To tackle this issue, I initiated the Django shell to access the database and fetch the migration history using SQL queries. 

The retrieved data revealed that only one migration entry existed for the "paradise" app, denoted as "0001_initial", suggesting the absence of subsequent migrations. Despite running makemigrations and migrate, the "No changes detected" message indicated that Django failed to recognise any alterations in the "paradise" app's models since the last migration.

However, upon closer inspection, it became evident that the "Merch" model was missing, leading to complications with the non-existent "paradise_merch" table. This discrepancy between the models and the database schema prompted corrective actions. To rectify the issue, I meticulously verified the models to ensure the accurate definition of the "Merch" model. Subsequently, I generated a new migration file using the makemigrations command with the --empty option. This generated a migration file devoid of model changes.

After confirming the inclusion of necessary operations to create the "Merch" model's table within the newly generated file, I manually edited the migration file (0002_auto_20240318_1712.py) in a text editor. Within the CreateModel operation, I defined the fields for the "Merch" model and saved the modifications.

Executing the migration command again resulted in the successful application of migration paradise.0002_auto_20240318_1712 without encountering any issues, resolving the discrepancies between the models and the database schema.

### Deployment
1.	Heroku App Creation: Created a new Heroku app with a unique name, specifying the desired region.
2.	Configuring Environment Variables: Added necessary environment variables, such as sensitive data or credentials, in the config vars section to ensure secure application operation.

|Key|Value|
|:----|:----|
|CLOUDINARY_URL|[Enter your cloudinary URL]|
|DATABASE_URL|[Enter your database URL (ElephantSQL)]|
|DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC|1 (This is only temporary, once you collectstatic you will need to remove it)|
|SECRET_KEY|[Enter your secret key (Find secure ones by using a generator)]|

3.	Adding Buildpacks: Installed additional dependencies essential for the application through buildpacks, including Python and Node.js.
4.	Selecting Deployment Method: Chose the preferred deployment method for the application.
5.	Connecting to GitHub: Selected GitHub as the deployment source and established a connection between the Heroku app and the GitHub repository, specifically linking to the repository named "Hell_Paradise".
6.	Manual Deployment: Deployed the application manually to ensure control over the deployment process.
7.	Viewing Deployment Logs: Reviewed the deployment logs to monitor the deployment progress and any potential issues.
8.	Successful Deployment Confirmation: Confirmed the successful deployment of the application with the message "App was successfully deployed".


### Local Deployment
Create a local copy of this project, you can either clone or fork it. Afterwards, ensure you have the required packages by installing them using pip3:

1.	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Additionally, create a file named env.py at the project's root and include the necessary environment variables as listed during the Heroku deployment steps. Here's a sample env.py file:

python code

|import os|
|:---:|
|	os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL"| "user's own value")|
|	os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL"| "user's own value")|
|	os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY"| "user's own value")|
|Local environment settings (avoid including these in production/deployment!) os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG","True")|

Once you've cloned or forked the project and set up the environment variables, follow these steps to run it locally:

Start the Django app:

3.	python3 manage.py runserver

Stop the app once it's loaded:

4.	CTRL+C or ⌘+C (for Mac)

Make any necessary migrations:

5.	python3 manage.py makemigrations

Migrate the data to the database:

6.	python3 manage.py migrate

Create a superuser:

7.	python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Load fixtures if applicable:

8.	python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json
(Repeat the above command for each file if multiple)

Finally, start the Django app again:

9.	python3 manage.py runserver

With these steps completed, your Django app should now be up and running locally.
